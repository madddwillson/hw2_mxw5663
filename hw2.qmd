Please read the instructions carefully before submitting your
assignment.

1.  This assignment requires you to only upload a `PDF` file on Canvas
2.  Don't collapse any code cells before submitting.
3.  Remember to make sure all your code output is rendered properly
    before uploading your submission.
:::

For this assignment, we will be using the [Abalone
dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone) from the UCI
Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of physical
measurements of abalone (a type of marine snail) and includes
information on the age, sex, and size of the abalone.

We will be using the following libraries:

``` {r}
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(cowplot)
```

## Question 1

::: callout-tip
## 30 points

EDA using `readr`, `tidyr` and `ggplot2`
:::

###### 1.1 (5 points)

Load the "Abalone" dataset as a tibble called `abalone` using the URL
provided below. The `abalone_col_names` variable contains a vector of
the column names for this dataset (to be consistent with the R naming
pattern). Make sure you read the dataset with the provided column names.

``` {r}
library(readr)
url <- "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data"

abalone_col_names <- c(
  "sex", 
  "length", 
  "diameter", 
  "height", 
  "whole_weight", 
  "shucked_weight", 
  "viscera_weight", 
  "shell_weight", 
  "rings"
)

abalone <- read_csv(url, col_names = abalone_col_names)
#View(abalone)
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 1.2 (5 points)

Remove missing values and `NA`s from the dataset and store the cleaned
data in a tibble called `df`. How many rows were dropped?

```{r}
df <- abalone %>% drop_na()
nrow(abalone) - nrow(df)
```
None were dropped.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### 1.3 (5 points)

Plot histograms of all the quantitative variables in a **single plot**
[^1]
[^1]: You can use the `facet_wrap()` function for this. Have a look at
    its documentation using the help console in R

``` {r}
# Insert your code here
df_long <- pivot_longer(df, -sex, names_to = "variable", values_to = "value")

ggplot(df_long, aes(x = value)) + 
          geom_histogram() + 
          facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free") +
          labs(x= "Value", y = "Frequency")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### 1.4 (5 points)

Create a boxplot of `length` for each `sex` and create a violin-plot of
of `diameter` for each `sex`. Are there any notable differences in the
physical appearences of abalones based on your analysis here?

``` {r}
# Insert your code for boxplot here
boxplot_length <- ggplot(df, aes(x = sex, y = length)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Sex", y = "Length") 
boxplot_length
```

``` {r}
 # Insert your code for violinplot here
violinplot_diameter <- ggplot(df, aes(x = sex, y = diameter)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(x = "Sex", y = "Diameter") 
violinplot_diameter
```
Female abalones have a longer length and a bigger diameter. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 1.5 (5 points)

Create a scatter plot of `length` and `diameter`, and modify the shape
and color of the points based on the `sex` variable. Change the size of
each point based on the `shell_wight` value for each observation. Are
there any notable anomalies in the dataset?

``` {r}
 # Insert your code here
plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x = length, y = diameter, color = sex, size = shell_weight)) + geom_point()
plot
```
The main anomaly is a I value at (.19,.039) with a smaller shell weight. The diameter is much bigger than standard for the length. There is another cluster of I points that are apart from the group, but they have smaller diameters than standard for their given length.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 1.6 (5 points)

For each `sex`, create separate scatter plots of `length` and
`diameter`. For each plot, also add a **linear** trend line to illustrate
the relationship between the variables. Use the `facet_wrap()` function
in R for this, and ensure that the plots are vertically stacked **not**
horizontally. You should end up with a plot that looks like this: [^2]

[^2]: Plot example for 1.6<br>
    [![](images/lines.png){style="height: 5em;"}]{.content-visible
    when-format="html"}

``` {r}
scatter_plots <- ggplot(df, aes(x = length, y = diameter, color = sex)) + 
          geom_point() + 
          geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") +
          facet_wrap(~ sex, scales = "free", ncol = 1) +
          labs(x= "Length", y = "Diameter")
scatter_plots
```

## Question 2

::: callout-tip
## 40 points

More advanced analyses using `dplyr`, `purrrr` and `ggplot2`
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 2.1 (10 points)

Filter the data to only include abalone with a length of at least $0.5$
meters. Group the data by `sex` and calculate the mean of each variable
for each group. Create a bar plot to visualize the mean values for each
variable by `sex`.

``` {r}
filtered <- df %>% filter(length >= .5)

# Group the  by sex and calculate the mean of each group's variables 
mean_values <- filtered %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize_all(mean)

mean_values_long <- pivot_longer(mean_values, -sex, names_to = "variable", values_to = "mean_value")

# Create a bar plot to visualize the mean values for each variable by sex
bar_plot <- ggplot(mean_values_long, aes(x = variable, y = mean_value, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Variable", y = "Mean Value") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability

bar_plot
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 2.2 (15 points)

Implement the following in a **single command**:

1.  Temporarily create a new variable called `num_rings` which takes a
    value of:

-   `"low"` if `rings < 10`
-   `"high"` if `rings > 20`, and
-   `"med"` otherwise

2.  Group `df` by this new variable and `sex` and compute `avg_weight`
    as the average of the
    `whole_weight + shucked_weight + viscera_weight + shell_weight` for
    each combination of `num_rings` and `sex`.

3.  Use the `geom_tile()` function to create a tile plot of `num_rings`
    vs `sex` with the color indicating of each tile indicating the
    `avg_weight` value.

``` {r}
df_plot <- df %>%
  mutate(num_rings = case_when(
    rings < 10 ~ "low",
    rings > 20 ~ "high",
    TRUE ~ "med"
  )) %>%
  group_by(num_rings, sex) %>%
  summarize(avg_weight = mean(whole_weight + shucked_weight + viscera_weight + shell_weight)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = num_rings, y = sex, fill = avg_weight)) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(x = "Number of Rings", y = "Sex", fill = "Average Weight") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "red") 

df_plot

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 2.3 (5 points)

Make a table of the pairwise correlations between all the numeric
variables rounded to 2 decimal points. Your final answer should look
like this [^3]

[^3]: Table for 2.3<br>

``` {r}
# Compute pairwise correlations rounded to 2 decimal points
correlation_table <- df %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%
  cor()

round(correlation_table, 3)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 2.4 (10 points)

Use the `map2()` function from the `purrr` package to create a scatter
plot for each *quantitative* variable against the number of `rings`
variable. Color the points based on the `sex` of each abalone. You can
use the `cowplot::plot_grid()` function to finally make the following
grid of plots.

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
![](images/plot_grid.png)
:::

``` {r}
quantitative_vars <- df %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) 

# Create scatter plots for each quantitative variable 
scatter_plots <- map2(quantitative_vars, names(quantitative_vars), function(var, name) {
  ggplot(df, aes_string(x = "rings", y = name, color = "sex")) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = paste("Scatter plot of", name, "vs. Rings"))
})

# Arrange grid
grid <- plot_grid(plotlist = scatter_plots, ncol = 3)
grid
```

## Question 3

## 30 points

Linear regression using `lm`
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 3.1 (10 points)

Perform a simple linear regression with `diameter` as the covariate and
`height` as the response. Interpret the model coefficients and their
significance values.

``` {r}
lm_model <- lm(height ~ diameter, data = df)
lm_model
summary(lm_model)
```
The model coefficients are the intercept which is -.003803 and the slope which is .351376. This means that the model says, if diameter could be zero, the associated height would be -.003803. The p-value for the intercept was .0119 which means it is significant since it is below .05. Also, for every unit of increase in diameter, the height increases by .351376. The p-value for the slope was <2e-16 meaning that it was even more significant since it is well below .05. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 3.2 (10 points)

Make a scatterplot of `height` vs `diameter` and plot the regression
line in `color="red"`. You can use the base `plot()` function in R for
this. Is the linear model an appropriate fit for this relationship?
Explain.

``` {r}
plot(df$diameter, df$height, main = "Height vs Diameter", xlab = "Diameter", ylab = "Height")
abline(lm(height ~ diameter, data = df), col = "red")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### 3.3 (10 points)

Suppose we have collected observations for "new" abalones with
`new_diameter` values given below. What is the expected value of their
`height` based on your model above? Plot these new observations along
with your predictions in your plot from earlier using `color="violet"`

``` {r}

new_diameters <- c(
  0.15218946,
  0.48361548,
  0.58095513,
  0.07603687,
  0.50234599,
  0.83462092,
  0.95681938,
  0.92906875,
  0.94245437,
  0.01209518
)


new_predictions <- predict(lm_model, newdata = data.frame(diameter = new_diameters))

plot(df$diameter, df$height, main = "Height vs Diameter", xlab = "Diameter", ylab = "Height")
abline(lm(height ~ diameter, data = df), col = "red")

new_predictions <- predict(lm_model, newdata = data.frame(diameter = new_diameters))
points(new_diameters, new_predictions, col = "violet")

```
